There was a big tree more than hundred years old located in the middle of a dry land. It gave rest and shelter to hundreds and thousands 
of travellers. The tree was located at the centre of four different towns, act as a connection point of all towns and villages in the 
nearby area. However, except the big old tree, there was no other tree that can offer rest to the people. The tree has a huge and broad 
trunk with innumerable branches which spread the shadow covering a wide space.
One day, two travellers were travelling from a distant place and tried to reach a town located at the east of the tree. They were 
walking for several miles on a hot and sunny day. They started their journey from early morning and it was almost mid noon. The sun was 
too hot and they could not walk anymore due to the heat. They were completely exhausted! Fortunately, they reached the place where the 
tree was located.
They were very happy to see such a big tree with breezing wind. They decided to take rest under the tree. They slept for some time 
happily enjoying the soothing cool breeze of the tree.
They felt hungry and one of the travellers decided to climb the branches to see whether the tree has any fruit.  Since it is not a fruit-
bearing tree, the traveller was disappointed.
He started cursing the tree owing to his hunger. ‘Oh, this is just a useless tree and it has nothing to feed us, not even a fruit or 
even nuts! It is of no use!’
The other traveller composed him and asked him to stay cool. However, the traveller was so angry due to hunger and cursed the tree.
The tree, which could not tolerate the cursing words of the traveller, in a sad yet strong voice, ‘You can’t be so ungrateful to me. 
Just look back at the condition when you reached here in the hot and dry sun! I offered you cool and comfortable place to rest and sleep 
with soothing breeze. If I’m not here when you are very tired you would have died now! I saved your life from the hot sun, but you 
humiliate me!’
The traveller realized his mistake and apologized to the tree.
Every creation of God has innumerable benefits to the mankind. There is good in everything and we often fails to notice the good! Also, 
don’t badmouth the one who helped you.
